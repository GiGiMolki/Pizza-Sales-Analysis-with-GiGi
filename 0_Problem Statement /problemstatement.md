## 🍕 Pizza Sales and Performance Analytics — Project Problem Statement

A local pizza chain is seeking to optimize its business operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost revenue. Despite having a structured relational database consisting of `orders`, `order_details`, `pizza`, and `pizza_types`, the management lacks meaningful insights to make data-driven decisions.

As a Data Analyst, your role is to explore the pizza sales data using advanced SQL queries and deliver actionable insights that support business strategy and operations.

  - 📊 Sales performance analysis
  - 🍕 Product popularity evaluation
  - 📆 Time-based trend analysis
  - 🧂 Ingredient and category-based segmentation
- Answer key business questions such as:

  - Which pizzas are ordered the most?
  - Which pizza sizes or categories generate the most revenue?
  - What are the top ingredients in best-selling pizzas?
  - What are the busiest days and hours for orders?
